# Real-Time Soil Moisture Monitoring and Smart Irrigation System using Arduino

## Overview

The **Real-Time Soil Moisture Monitoring and Smart Irrigation System** is an Arduino-based project designed to monitor the moisture content of soil using a soil moisture sensor. The sensor continuously measures the moisture level and sends analog data to the Arduino Uno. Based on predefined threshold values, the system classifies the soil as **Dry**, **Medium Moisture**, or **Wet** and displays the result on the Arduino Serial Monitor.

This project demonstrates the basics of sensor interfacing, analog data processing, and real-time monitoring, making it suitable for smart agriculture and beginner IoT applications.

# Working Principle

1. The Arduino initializes serial communication at **9600 baud rate**.
2. The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture content of the soil.
3. Arduino reads the analog value from **A0**.
4. The sensor value is compared with predefined threshold values.
5. The soil condition is determined as:
   - Dry Soil
   - Medium Moisture
   - Wet Soil
6. The result is displayed on the Serial Monitor.
7. The process repeats every **100 milliseconds**.

# Threshold Values

| Sensor Value | Soil Condition |
|--------------|----------------|
| Greater than 950 | 🌵 Dry Soil |
| 400 to 950 | 🌿 Medium Moisture |
| Less than 400 | 💧 Wet Soil |

# Sample Output

```text
Sensor_data:986 | No moisture, Soil is dry

Sensor_data:742 | There is some moisture, Soil is medium

Sensor_data:315 | Soil is wet
```
